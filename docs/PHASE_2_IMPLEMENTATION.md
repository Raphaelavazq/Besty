# Phase 2 Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented all remaining UX improvements from the audit. All items from Phase 1 and Phase 2 are now complete!

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ P2-8: Haptic Feedback
**Files Modified:**
- Created `src/utils/haptics.js` - Haptic feedback utility library
- Updated `HoerenPlayer.jsx` - Added haptic feedback to all interactions
- Updated `HoerenPruefung.jsx` - Added haptic feedback to navigation buttons

**Features:**
- `triggerHaptic()` - Standard 10ms vibration for button clicks
- `triggerSuccessHaptic()` - Double-tap pattern [10, 50, 10] for success
- `triggerErrorHaptic()` - Longer 30ms vibration for errors
- Progressive enhancement - fails gracefully on unsupported devices
- Haptic feedback on:
  - Play/Pause button clicks
  - Replay button clicks
  - Answer selection (all question types)
  - Next button clicks
  - Navigation button clicks
  - Audio loading errors

**User Experience:**
Mobile users get tactile feedback on every interaction, making the app feel more responsive and native-like. Works on iOS Safari and Android Chrome browsers that support the Vibration API.

### ✅ P2-10: Teil 4 Text Wrapping
**Files Modified:**
- `HoerenPlayer.jsx` line ~273

**Changes:**
- Added `line-clamp-3` class to Teil 4 statement text
- Combined with existing `break-words` for proper wrapping
- Text truncates to 3 lines with ellipsis if too long
- Prevents horizontal scrolling on small screens

**User Experience:**
Long statements in Teil 4 (matching questions) now wrap properly and don't overflow the container. Text is limited to 3 visible lines to keep the UI compact and scannable.

---

### ✅ P2-12: Audio Error Handling
**Files Modified:**
- `HoerenPlayer.jsx`

**Features:**
- Added `audioError` state to track loading failures
- Added `error` event listener to audio element
- Error banner displays above audio player with:
  - Red background with border (bg-red-100 border-red-300)
  - Alert icon (AlertCircle from lucide-react)
  - Primary message: "Audio konnte nicht geladen werden"
  - Secondary help text: "Überprüfe deine Internetverbindung und versuche es erneut."
- Triggers error haptic feedback (30ms vibration) when audio fails
- Error state resets when audio file changes

**User Experience:**
If audio fails to load (network error, missing file, format issue), user sees a clear error message with actionable advice. No more silent failures or confusion about why play button doesn't work.

---

### ✅ Edge Case: Prüfung Back Button Confirmation
**Files Modified:**
- `HoerenPruefung.jsx`

**Features:**
- Created `handleBackClick()` function
- Shows browser confirmation dialog when user tries to navigate away during active test
- Message: "Möchten Sie wirklich abbrechen? Ihr Fortschritt geht verloren."
- Only shows during active test (not on results screen)
- Applies to all back/exit buttons in the test flow
- Triggers haptic feedback on navigation

**User Experience:**
Prevents accidental test abandonment. If user clicks back button, they must confirm they want to lose their progress. After test is complete (results screen), no confirmation needed.

---

### ✅ Edge Case: Page Refresh Warning
**Files Modified:**
- `HoerenPruefung.jsx`

**Features:**
- Added `beforeunload` event listener
- Tracks test state with `testStarted` flag
- Browser shows warning dialog: "Test wird abgebrochen. Möchten Sie wirklich die Seite verlassen?"
- Only shows during active test (not before start or after completion)
- Standard browser dialog (cannot be customized for security)
- Event listener cleaned up on component unmount

**User Experience:**
If user accidentally tries to refresh page, close tab, or navigate away during test, browser shows warning dialog to prevent data loss. Native browser protection against accidental navigation.

- [ ] Play/Pause vibrates (10ms)
- [ ] Navigation buttons vibrate (10ms)
- [ ] Audio error vibrates (30ms)

### Audio Error Testing
