# Production Environment Variables for Vercel
# DO NOT set VITE_BACKEND_URL here - we want it to use relative /api/chat
# Only set OPENAI_API_KEY in Vercel dashboard

# OPENAI_API_KEY should be set in Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# This file is just a reference - actual values are set in Vercel
